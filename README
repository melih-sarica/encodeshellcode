encodeshellcode-0.1b.tar.gz
---------------------------

	If you're dealing with a character filter or byte restriction in a buffer overflow 
vulnerability or some kind of IDS/IPS/AV blocking your code, you can use this encoder for 
encoding your 32-bit x86 shellcode.

	This technique was used by muts from offensive security. As a summary, shellcode is 
divided into small subsets then using arithmetic or logical operators we rebuild the shellcode 
to some place on the stack. Doing this by hand is very time consuming and error prone so i've 
created this simple encoder, i hope it'll be useful for you too. You can add new instruction 
sets to source code if you ever need. 

Required arguments:
	-a <file>            : Available chars file.
	-s <file>            : Shellcode file.
	-o <file>            : Output file for new shellcode.
Optional arguments:
	-i <instruction set> : Instruction set to use. (0=auto (default), 1=first, 2=second, etc.) (2 instruction sets available.)
	-t <offset>          : Offset from ESP.
	-v                   : Verbose/debug mode.
	-h                   : This help.
